         +"<p>There are a few parts to a website. Every modern website has a \"database\", "
         +   "so that it can store data, like users, posts, pictures, etc. You can setup "
         +   "your own data storage on the Data Storage page.</p>"

         +"<p>Then we'll pick a nice looking theme, so that your site looks fresh.</p>"

         +"<p>Then, you can start making your web pages! This includes everything you see on a webpage, "
         +   "Like a nav bar, paragraph text, forms, buttons, etc. You can even do things like make a dynamic page, "
         +   "like a user profile page, which contains dynamic inforation about the user from your sites database</p>"

         +"<p>After that, you'll have a functional website, "
         +   "and you'll even be able to download and browse the code that was generated!</p>"
