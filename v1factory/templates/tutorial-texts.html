  <p>Welcome to v1 Factory Alpha!</p>
  <p>v1 Factory is a site builder that helps you build your dynamic website fast, without writing code.</p>
  <p>This tutorial will help you understand the basics of building a website using v1 Factory, and by the end of it, you'll have a live, working site, and you'll be able to download your site's codebase.</p>
</script>


<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-overview">
  <p>There are several components to a site built using v1 Factory:</p>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <p>Control your application's data, such as users, listings, likes, comments, etc.</p>

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>Customize the overall look and feel of your site, including colors, fonts, buttons, etc.</p>

  <h2>Pages</h2>
  <p>Customize the layout, content, and logic of your pages.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-app_info">
<p>***Here are some keywords that will be used to help people find your site via a search engine like google.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-data_storage">
<p>Your application has a database to store information about users and their interaction with the site.
For example, when a user signs up or submits a form, the data is saved in your site's database.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-data_storage-entity">
  <p>You can think of the database as similar to a bunch of Excel spreadsheet.
  We'll work through the example of a User.</p>

</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-data_storage-user">
  <p>By default, your v1 Factory database ships with a User spreadsheet. This is where the application
  stores information about it's users, such as their names, email addresses, etc.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-data_storage-sample">
  <p>If you're creating a blog website, you would want to store blog data in a spreadsheet.
  Create a spreadsheet called "Posts". You would have a column for the title and one for the content.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-data_storage-upload">
  <p>You can download the data from your database in the form of an excel spreadsheet, and upload
  an excel sheet to populate the database.</p>
</script>


<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-themes_design">
  <p>A theme defines the look and feel of the basic UI Elements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Headers</li>
    <li>Texts</li>
    <li>Fonts</li>
    <li>Buttons</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Links</li>
    <li>Forms</li>
    <li>Lines</li>
    <li>Dropdowns</li>
    <li>Containers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Different themes will give your site a different feel - ie, modern, antiquated, childish, or professional.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-themes_design-existingdesign">
  <p>If you know CSS, make your own theme!</p>
  <p>If not, hire a v1 Factory programmer to theme-ify your site.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-pages">
  <p>The pages screen is where you can create and edit the urls of your pages. For example,
  you could set up your site to have a homepage and a registration page.</p>

  <p>You can edit the URLs of your pages to your liking, and you can also have dynamic URLs,
  such as "yoursite.com/listing/2123231/description".
  Dynamic URLs are explained further in the next topic.</p>

</script>

<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-pages-context">
  <p>Some pages live at a URL you can clearly define, like "yoursite.com/registration_page".
  Other pages are different though, because they have some data in the URL, which tells
  the website how to fill the page with content. For example, "yoursite.com/post/5" tells your site
  to show the page, filled with the data from the post with an ID of 5. You can do this by selecting "Post id"
  from the drop down on the URL screen *.</p>

  <p>Rule of thumb: When you say "this is a page for a post" or "this is a page for a user profile", you
  know you need an ID in the url to tell the site which post or user profile it should use to fill the page with data.</p>
</script>
<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-editor">
  <p>When you click "edit page" on the pages, you will be able to use the Editor to modify your pages.
  You can drag elements from the right panel onto the page. Then, you can resize the container for that element,
  change the content, etc.</p>
</script>
<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-editor-lists">
  <p>Text and links are very basic elements, but there are times when you want to drop a table or a dynamic list of elements.
  You may, for example, want to drop a list of apartment listings onto the page. If you already have a spreadsheet for apartment listings
  set up (see the Data and storage section), you'll see a "List of Apartment_listings" button on the panel.
  When you drop that onto the page, you'll be shown a window where you can edit how the list of apartments will look,
  and you can even filter down the list of apartments that are shown, ie show only the listings that belong
  to the currently logged in user.</p>
</script>
<script type="text/template" id="tutorial-editor-forms">
  <p>When you drop a form onto the page, a similar thing will happen, and you'll be able to edit the form fields,
  and contol what happens when the user submits the form.</p>
</script>
